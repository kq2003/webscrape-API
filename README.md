# webscrape-API

I wrote an API that can webscrape data and information from different websites during my first internship. (2022 May - Aug).

I webscraped data from Hupu, Twitter, and Whoscored by using Selenium, Beautiful soup, CSS, and Regex (in player_list.py, I used regex to filter player's names in whoscored). I also wrote an automated email sender in the end.
